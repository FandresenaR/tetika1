# OpenRouter API Authentication Fix

This update resolves the 401 Unauthorized authentication issues that occurred when using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) mode with OpenRouter API.

## Key Fixes

### 1. Enhanced API Key Format Validation
- Added robust format checking for OpenRouter API keys
- Improved validation logic to ensure keys start with `sk-or-` or `sk-o1-` prefixes
- Added automatic detection and conversion of hex format keys to OpenRouter format

### 2. Fixed OpenRouter Authorization Headers
- Properly constructed Authorization headers with valid token format
- Added detailed error logging for authentication issues
- Fixed whitespace handling in API key cleaning

### 3. Added RAG Mode-Specific Key Handling
- Added special validation for API keys in RAG mode
- Pre-validated API keys before sending requests in RAG mode
- Fixed client-provided key formatting issues

### 4. Validation Tools
- Created a new validation script `validate-openrouter-key.js` for testing keys
- Added more comprehensive error messages for different API key issues

## Testing Your Setup

You can use the new validation script to test your OpenRouter API key:

```bash
node validate-openrouter-key.js YOUR_API_KEY
```

The script will:
1. Validate the format of your key
2. Convert hex keys to the proper OpenRouter format if needed
3. Test the key with a real API call
4. Provide recommendations based on the results

## Important Notes

- OpenRouter API keys should start with `sk-or-` or `sk-o1-` prefixes
- If you have a 64-character hex key, it needs to be converted to `sk-or-v1-[hex_key]` format
- The .env.local file should contain properly formatted keys
- RAG mode now has additional validation to prevent authentication issues
