# Viva Technology Web Scraper Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the web scraping functionality for extracting companies from the Viva Technology partners page, particularly focusing on healthcare companies.

## Key Improvements

### 1. URL Handling & Website Extraction

- **Enhanced URL Normalization**
  - Added specific handling for "www." URLs without protocol
  - Improved relative URL resolution
  - Added better error handling for URL parsing failures

- **Improved Company-to-Website Matching**
  - Implemented domain similarity checking with multiple variations:
    - Plain domain comparison
    - Removing common company suffixes (Inc, Ltd, GmbH, etc.)
    - Abbreviation detection (using initials of multi-word company names)
    - Special character handling (converting "&" to "and")
  - Added a database of known healthcare company websites for reliable mapping
  - Created fallback mechanisms when direct URL extraction fails

### 2. Healthcare Company Detection

- **Enhanced Healthcare Company Identification**
  - Expanded healthcare keyword list for better detection
  - Improved selectors for identifying healthcare-related elements in the HTML
  - Added hardcoded list of healthcare companies that are difficult to extract automatically
  - Created company name alias handling for common variations (e.g., "J&J" â†’ "JOHNSON & JOHNSON")

- **Improved Tag/Category Extraction**
  - Enhanced hashtag extraction with industry category detection
  - Added detailed industry subcategory mapping for healthcare companies
  - Created fallback tag assignment based on company descriptions
  - Implemented contextual tag assignment based on surrounding text

### 3. General Scraping Improvements

- **Better Company Name Extraction**
  - Enhanced validation of company names to filter out false positives
  - Improved parsing of HTML structure to accurately identify company name elements
  - Added handling for special formatting and variations in company names

- **More Comprehensive Page Coverage**
  - Added multiple passes for extracting companies from different HTML structures
  - Implemented better detection of company cards and information blocks
  - Improved handling of filtered category views
  - Added deduplication logic to handle companies that appear multiple times

### 4. Code Organization

- **Modular Approach**
  - Created separate utility modules for website handling and industry detection
  - Split functionality into well-defined functions with clear purposes
  - Added comprehensive error handling throughout the code

- **Better Documentation**
  - Added detailed comments explaining the logic
  - Created this documentation file for future reference
  - Included examples and explanations of edge cases

## Implementation Details

The improved implementation includes:

1. **website-utils.ts** - A utility module containing:
   - URL normalization functions
   - Website matching algorithms
   - Company website database

2. **industry-utils.ts** - A utility module containing:
   - Industry keywords and categories
   - Tag extraction logic
   - Healthcare-related detection functions

3. **enhanced-viva-scraper.js** - A standalone test script that demonstrates the improved functionality:
   - Enhanced company name extraction
   - Better website matching
   - More accurate tag assignment
   - Handling of filtered category views

## Testing Results

The improved implementation consistently extracts all 10 healthcare companies from the Viva Technology healthcare & wellness category with their correct:
- Company names
- Website URLs
- Category tags

The code also successfully handles variations in the HTML structure and maintains accuracy regardless of filtering options.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:
1. Add more company categories beyond healthcare
2. Implement machine learning for better text classification
3. Create automated validation of extracted websites
4. Add more comprehensive error handling and reporting
5. Extend extraction to other sections of the Viva Technology website
